# What is an ENS?

ENS stands for Ethereum Name Service. It is a decentralized domain name service built on top of the Ethereum blockchain. Just like how domain names are used to identify websites on the internet, ENS allows users to register human-readable names (such as “myname.eth”) and map them to Ethereum addresses, which are otherwise long strings of numbers and letters.

ENS provides a number of benefits, including improved usability and security for blockchain users. Instead of relying on long, complex Ethereum addresses, users can send and receive transactions using easy-to-remember names. ENS also supports features such as subdomains, aliases, and reverse resolution, which can help simplify the user experience.

Overall, ENS is an important tool for building user-friendly, decentralized applications on the Ethereum blockchain.
