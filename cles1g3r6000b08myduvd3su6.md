zkSync is a Layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum that is designed to increase the transaction processing capacity of the Ethereum network while reducing the fees and latency associated with on-chain transactions. It is built using zero-knowledge proofs, which allows for the verification of transactions without revealing the details of the transaction, providing a high degree of privacy and security.

zkSync is designed to support a range of use cases, including payments, decentralized exchanges, and NFT marketplaces. It is built using a rollup architecture, which means that transactions are batched together off-chain and then committed to the Ethereum network as a single transaction. This reduces the load on the Ethereum network, allowing for more efficient use of the blockchain's limited resources.

One of the key benefits of zkSync is its low transaction fees. Because transactions are processed off-chain, the gas fees associated with on-chain transactions are significantly reduced. Additionally, zkSync is designed to be compatible with existing Ethereum infrastructure, meaning that developers can build on top of it using the same tools and programming languages they are already familiar with.

Overall, zkSync is a promising solution for scaling Ethereum that could significantly improve the network's transaction processing capacity and reduce fees for users.
