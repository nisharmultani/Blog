### **11 ) What is the purpose of the key prop in React?**

\-&gt; The key prop is used to uniquely identify elements in a list of components. It helps React to efficiently update the list when new items are added, removed, or reordered.

### **12 ) What is the difference between stateless and stateful components in React?**

\-&gt; Stateless components, also known as functional components, are components that don't have state and don't rely on lifecycle methods. They are simpler and more efficient than stateful components. Stateful components, also known as class components, have state and can use lifecycle methods to manage their state.

### **13) What are React Hooks and how do they work?**

\-&gt; React Hooks are functions that allow you to use state and other React features without writing class components. They were introduced in React 16.8 and provide a simpler way to manage component state and lifecycle methods.

### **14) What is the purpose of the useContext() Hook in React?**

\-&gt; The useContext() Hook is used to consume context in a functional component. It allows you to access data that is shared across the component tree without having to pass props down manually.

### **15) What is the difference between React and React Native?**

\-&gt; React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces for web applications, while React Native is a framework for building native mobile applications using React. React Native allows developers to write native mobile apps using JavaScript and provides access to native APIs and components.

### **16 ) What is the purpose of the useEffect() Hook in React?**

\-&gt; The useEffect() Hook is used to manage side effects in a functional component. It allows you to perform side effects like fetching data, setting up event listeners, and manipulating the DOM after a component has rendered.

### **17 ) What is the purpose of the useRef() Hook in React?**

\-&gt; The useRef() Hook is used to create a reference to a DOM element or to store mutable data that persists across renders. It can be used to access DOM nodes or to store values that need to persist across renders, without causing the component to re-render.

### **18) What is the purpose of the useMemo() Hook in React?**

\-&gt; The useMemo() Hook is used to memoize expensive calculations in a functional component. It caches the result of a calculation and returns it if the input values have not changed, thus avoiding unnecessary recalculations.

### **19) What is the purpose of the useCallback() Hook in React?**

The useCallback() Hook is used to memoize event handler functions in a functional component. It caches the function and returns it if the dependencies have not changed, thus avoiding unnecessary re-renders.

### **20) What is server-side rendering in React?**

Server-side rendering is a technique that allows you to render React components on the server and send the HTML to the client, instead of sending a blank HTML page and waiting for the client to load and render the components. This can improve performance and SEO.
