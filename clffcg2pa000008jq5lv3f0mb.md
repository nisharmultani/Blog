### **1) What is React?**

\-&gt; React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

### 2) What are the key features of React?

\-&gt; The key features of React are:

* **Declarative**: React makes it easy to build complex UIs by breaking them down into smaller, reusable components.
    
* **Virtual DOM:** React uses a virtual DOM to improve performance by minimizing the number of DOM manipulations.
    
* **JSX**: React uses JSX, a syntax extension that allows you to write HTML-like syntax in your JavaScript code.
    
* **One-way data flow**: React follows a unidirectional data flow, which means that data flows only in one direction, from parent to child components.
    
* **Component-based architecture:** React is built around the idea of reusable components, which can be composed to build complex UIs,
    
    ### **3) What is JSX?**
    
    \-&gt; JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows you to write HTML-like syntax in your JavaScript code. It is used to describe the structure of React components.
    
    ### **4) What is the difference between props and state in React?**
    
    \-&gt; Props (short for properties) are passed down from a parent component to a child component as immutable data. State is mutable data that is managed within a component.
    
    ### **5) What is the lifecycle of a React component?**
    
    The lifecycle of a React component consists of three phases:
    
    Mounting: When a component is first created and added to the DOM.
    
    Updating: When a component's props or state change.
    
    Unmounting: When a component is removed from the DOM
    
    ### **6) What is the purpose of React Router?**
    
    \-&gt; React Router is a library that allows you to implement client-side routing in a React application. It enables navigation between different components without the need to refresh the page.
    
    ### **7) What are Higher-Order Components (HOCs)?**
    
    \-&gt; Higher-Order Components (HOCs) are functions that take a component and return a new component with added functionality. They are commonly used for cross-cutting concerns like logging, authentication, and authorization.
    
    ### **8) What is Redux and how does it work with React?**
    
    \-&gt; Redux is a predictable state management library for JavaScript applications. It is often used with React to manage application state in a central location. React components can dispatch actions to the Redux store, which in turn updates the state and triggers a re-render of the affected components.
    
    ### **9) What is the difference between controlled and uncontrolled components in React?**
    
    \-&gt; Controlled components are components that have their state managed by React, meaning that their values are set by props and updated through event handlers. Uncontrolled components, on the other hand, have their state managed by the DOM, meaning that their values are read from the DOM using refs.
    
    ### **10) What is the purpose of shouldComponentUpdate() method in React?**
    
    \-&gt; shouldComponentUpdate() is a lifecycle method in React that determines whether a component should re-render or not. It can be used to optimize performance by preventing unnecessary re-renders.
